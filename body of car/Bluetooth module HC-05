HC-05:
•	HC-05 is a Bluetooth module which is designed for wireless communication. This module can be used in a master or slave configuration.
•	Bluetooth serial modules allow all serial enabled devices to communicate with each other using Bluetooth.

HC-05 pin description:
  It has 6 pins:
•	1.  Key/EN: It is used to bring Bluetooth module in AT commands mode. If Key/EN pin is set to high, then this module will work in command mode. Otherwise by default it is in data mode.
•	HC-05 module has two modes,
          1.  Data mode: Exchange of data between devices.
          2.  Command mode: It uses AT commands which are used to change setting of HC-05. To send these commands to module serial (USART) port is used.
•	2.  VCC: Connect 5 V or 3.3 V to this Pin.
•	3.  GND: Ground Pin of module.
•	4.  TXD: Transmit Serial data (wirelessly received data by Bluetooth module transmitted out serially on TXD pin)
•	5.  RXD: Receive data serially (received data will be transmitted wirelessly by Bluetooth module).
•	6.  State: It tells whether module is connected or not.

HC-05 module Information
•	HC-05 has red LED which indicates connection status, whether the Bluetooth is connected or not. Before connecting to HC-05 module this red LED blinks continuously in a periodic manner. When it gets connected to any other Bluetooth device, its blinking slows down to two seconds.
•	This module works on 3.3 V. We can connect 5V supply voltage as well since the module has on board 5 to 3.3 V regulator.
•	As HC-05 Bluetooth module has 3.3 V level for RX/TX and microcontroller can detect 3.3 V level, so, no need to shift transmit level of HC-05 module. But we need to shift the transmit voltage level from microcontroller to RX of HC-05 module.
Difference between HC-05 and HC-06:
•	HC-05 can be set in master and slave modes. 
•	HC-06 can only be set in slave mode.
