Why 4 Wheels? 
1.More stable against overturning due to it's symmetric combination 
2.We need 4-wheel car because it will be more capable of moving with the weights on it (arduino mega, motor drive, etc.) to split the force and decrease the pressure on the road. (better lifting capacity)
3. Additional weight contributes to better grip on the road.
4. Excellent traction in off-road situations and ability to switch between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive for better fuel efficiency
Disadvantages:
1.it will be slower due to its weight
Sol: choosing components with higher operational voltage
(EX:l298 instead of l293 motor drive)
2.economically low
Sol: figure out a better cost plan
