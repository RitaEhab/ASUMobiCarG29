This circuit is based on LDR properties which is made of semiconductors 
where when light increse resistance decrease and vice vers where resistance
can reach in range of mega ohms which decrease inrensity of light obiously as shown
in a vedioe we made 
this can be illustrated by the following :
semiconductors made by doping as light increase number of free electrons increase 
so its ability to conduct increse so led light increase
